Data abstraction
--------------
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

abstract class
interface

Interface
-----
1) An interface is a blue print of class.
2) Interface contains final & Static variables.
3) Interface contains abstract methods.( also allowed default methods & Static methods from java8 onwards)
4) An abstract method is a method contains signature but not body(Un-implemented method).
5) Methods in interface are public.
6) Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
7) We can define interface with interface keyword.
8) A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but aÂ class implements an interface.
9) We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
