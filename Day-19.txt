Types of exceptions
-------
1) Checked exceptions
The exceptions which are identified by java compiler.
	Ex: InteruptedException
     		FileNotFound
		IOException etc...

2) Un-checked exceptions

The exceptions which are not identified by java compiler.
Ex:
		ArithmeticException
		NullPointerException
		ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc...
			etc...

try
{

}
catch(Exception name)
{

}
finally
{

}


If you do not knw what type of exception comes then you have 2 solutions to handle.

1) multiple catch blocks
2) by specifying Exception class in catch.

finally block
-------------
case1: Exception occured, catch block handled ---> finally block will execute
case2: Exception occured, catch block NOT handled --> finally block will execute
case3: Exception does not occured, catch block ignored ----> finally block will execute

try
{
open connection with DB.
}
catch()
{
Handle exception
}
finally
{
close connection
}


checked exceptions can be handled in 2 ways
----
using try..catch
throws
