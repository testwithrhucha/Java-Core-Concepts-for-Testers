Day-5
--------
Looping statements
-------------

loop  or iteration -  executing same set of statements multiple times.

1) while 
2) do while
3) for loop


Initilization
condition
incrementation


while(condition)
{
statements;
}



do
{
statements;
}while(condition);


for(initilization; condition ; inc/dec )
{
statements;
}


** which loop is prefered to use
-----
* If you know the number of iterations in advance, the for loop is often the most suitable. 
* If you want to execute the loop at least once, the do-while loop is appropriate. 
* If you are uncertain about the number of iterations and the loop termination is based on a condition, the while loop is a good choice.


Bike --> for
bus -- > do while
flight ----> while

Jumping statements
----------
break
continue


control statements
-------
conditional ----> if   if--else   switch case
loops ----------> while    do-while   for
jump ------------> break  continue


for - enhanced for loop(for each loop)

this loop especially design for collections like   arrays, list, hashmap.....
